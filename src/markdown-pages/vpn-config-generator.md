description: "Internal tool used to automate generating vpn configuration files and keys. Used in group projects to keep track of who had access to my server. Used MySQL database to store user information so I knew which key belonged to which user. PHP script triggered bash script to create new keys for users, and also inserted a record into the SQL database."
