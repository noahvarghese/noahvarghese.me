description: "Built as an internal tool so I do not have plain text passwords stored in code. Written originally as an excuse to learn rails. Uses openSSL to encrypt/decrypt a given string. Rewritten in vanilla php so as to reduce unnecessary bloat. Currently uses iv generated on install by user. Can be extended to use user specific iv's kept in database to keep encryption even more secure."
