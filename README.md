  My Portfolio Site
</h1>

Kick off your portfolio with this boilerplate. This uses Gatsby to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Use as your own template**

    Clone this repository

    ```shell
    # create a new portfolio site using noahvarghese.me
    git clone https://github.com/noahvarghese/noahvarghese.me
    ```

1.  **Install npm packages**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and install npm dependencies.

    ```shell
    cd noahvarghese.me/
    npm i
    ```
    
1. **Start developing**
    Start it up!

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `noahvarghese.me` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1. **Replace with your own projects!**
    
    Remove existing projects in src/markdown-pages/
    
    Add your own projects by creating markdown files, filling in these fields in the frontmatter;
